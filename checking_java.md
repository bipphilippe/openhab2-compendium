Checking Java
===============================

Before anything else, check that the correct version of Java is installed.

To do this :

1. Open the terminal window
2. Type the following command.
	java -version
3. You should see something like this :

'''cal:~ callas$ java -version
java version "1.8.0 73"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_73-b02)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.73-b02, mixed mode)
'''
