# Who should read this book

This book has been built from the experience of building an Home Automation using OpenHab 2 and some bindings.

Doing so, I had to read dozen of pages of posts, articles and FAQ.

It is shared with the community in order to avoid other people these longs readings and, hopefully, in order to see it enhanced by other contributors.

Even if it is primarily focused on some bindings and extensions, as Z-Wave and HABmin 2, this book has been structured to be easy do extend.
