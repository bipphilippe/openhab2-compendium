# Who should read this book

This book has been built from the experience of building an Home Automation using OpenHab 2, Z-Wave and HABmin 2.

Doing so, I had to read dozen of pages of posts, articles and FAQ.

It is shared with the community in order to avoid other people these longs readings and, hopefully, in order to see it enhanced by other contributors.
