# Z-Wave and HABmin

The goal of HABmin2 is to provide a modern, professional and portable user interface for openHAB, providing user functions, administrative functions  and configuration utilities to aid setup. 

HABmin is intended as a complete GUI for the openHAB Home Automation system but it is also built with Z-Wave specific functionalities. It is the reason why we will introduce HABmin there.
